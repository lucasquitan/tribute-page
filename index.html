                <p>Ayrton Senna da Silva (21 March 1960 ‚Äì 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver who won the Formula
                    One World Drivers' Championship in 1988, 1990, and 1991. Senna is one of three Formula One drivers
                    from Brazil to win the World Championship and won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with the
                    latter being the record until 2006. He died in an accident leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix
                    driving for the Williams team.

                <p>Senna began his motorsport career in karting, moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981 and won the 1983
                    British Formula Three Championship. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before
                    moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons.
                    In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the
                    16 Grands Prix that year, and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the
                    championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the
                    Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the
                    1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.</p>

                <p>Senna was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the
                    record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the
                    1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a
                    record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in
                    terms of race wins and has won more races for McLaren than any other driver. Senna courted
                    controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the
                    Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year,
                    collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.</p>

                <h4>The Death</h4>

                <p>On 1 May 1994, Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna was killed after his car crashed into a
                    concrete barrier while he was leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino
                    Ferrari in Italy. The previous day, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger had died when his car
                    crashed during qualification for the race. His and Senna's crashes were the worst of several that
                    took place that weekend (including a serious one involving Rubens Barrichello) and were the first
                    fatal collisions to occur during a Formula One race meeting in 12 years (and not repeated until the
                    fatal crash of Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit). This became a
                    turning point in the safety of Formula One, prompting the implementation of new safety measures in
                    both Formula One and the circuit, as well as the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to be
                    reestablished. The Supreme Court of Cassation of Italy ruled that mechanical failure was the cause
                    of the crash, although this has been disputed.</p>
